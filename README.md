# pyat_tools

- This repository is designed to have added functionality built on top of pyat https://github.com/hunterakins/pyat
- The main thing that this code can do is loop through kraken for different frequencies and create a bandlimited TDGF
- All of this code is heavily specific to my personal research and isn't really designed for others in mind, but you may still find it useful which is why I made it public 👍
